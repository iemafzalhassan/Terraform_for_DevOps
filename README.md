## Directory Structure

### **Module 01: Introduction to Terraform**
This module sets the stage for learning Terraform by explaining its history, purpose, and importance in managing infrastructure.

- **Subtopics:**
  1. **What is Terraform?**
      - Imagine you are the architect of a virtual city (your infrastructure). Terraform is your blueprint to design and build this city with just a few commands.
  2. **Why Use Terraform?**
      - Terraform automates repetitive tasks and ensures every part of your "city" (infrastructure) is consistent and scalable.
  3. **How Terraform Solves Problems:**
      - Manual provisioning was like building your city brick by brick. Terraform helps you plan and build with ease.

### **Module 02: Installing Terraform**
Learn how to set up Terraform on your computer and get started with hands-on practice.

- **Subtopics:**
  1. **Step-by-Step Installation:**
      - Follow clear instructions to install Terraform on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
  2. **First Steps with Terraform:**
      - Verify your installation and run your first Terraform command.
  3. **Troubleshooting:**
      - What to do if you encounter issues during setup.

### **Module 03: Basics of Terraform Configuration**
Dive into the fundamental building blocks of Terraform.

- **Subtopics:**
  1. **Understanding Configuration Files:**
      - Terraform uses .tf files to define your "city." Learn how to write and read them.
  2. **Providers and Resources:**
      - Providers are like construction companies, and resources are the buildings they construct.
  3. **The Terraform Workflow:**
      - Plan, Apply, and Destroy: Build your "city," review changes, and tear it down if needed.

---

### **Module 04: Terraform State**
Understand how Terraform keeps track of your infrastructure.

- **Subtopics:**
  1. **What is Terraform State?**
      - Think of it as a memory card for your "city," remembering what you've built.
  2. **Managing State Files:**
      - Learn where the memory card is stored and how to back it up.
  3. **Best Practices for State Management:**
      - Tips for keeping your state files secure and up-to-date.

---

### **Module 05: Advanced Terraform Concepts**
Take your skills to the next level with advanced features of Terraform.

- **Subtopics:**
  1. **Modules:**
      - Reuse and organize your "city" plans with Terraform modules.
  2. **Variables and Outputs:**
      - Simplify your configurations with variables, and retrieve useful information with outputs.
  3. **Remote Backends:**
      - Store your state file in the cloud to collaborate with others.
